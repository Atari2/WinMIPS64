# WinMIPS64 

WinMIPS64 is a simulator of the MIPS architecture, created by Mike Scott (mscott@indigo.ie). Original Website: http://indigo.ie/~mscott

Nowadays it is still used for teaching in various spanish-speaking universities.

This fork fixes the issue with the 200 characters line limit and changes back the spanish translation to english.
